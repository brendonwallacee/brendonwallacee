# Hi! I’m Brendon!
I'm 22 years old, ASD student(Analysis and Systems Development).

I'm really into technologies, so there's nothing better that study software development and AI!:grin:

I’m currently learning Data Science + Graphics Interface with Python, OOP(Object-Oriented Programming) with Java and now I,m trying to learn about GIT.
